#     agent TTFT, warm      0.31-0.48 s on a 20k-token conversation, flat as it grows
#
# WHY THE CACHES MATTER. The first inference after a load costs 34-50 s on a cold box -- Triton compiling
# kernels plus exllamav3's own coop autotuner exploring GEMM shapes. Both persist to disk if told where:
#   TRITON_CACHE_DIR        -> Triton's kernel cache (the vendored FLA kernels set cache_results=True)
#   EXLLAMAV3_TUNE_CACHE    -> coop_autotune_v1.bin (exllamav3/exllamav3_ext/quant/coop_autotune.cu:75-77)
# With an empty cache the warmup measured 21.5 s; warm, 0.85 s. That is the difference between a 80 s and a
# 31 s start, and it is why the caches are mounted rather than left inside the container.
#
# WHY THERE IS A SAMPLER PRESET. TabbyAPI has no sampling fallbacks unless `sampling.override_preset` names
# one, and it says so at boot: "Requests that omit them run untruncated: temperature 1.0, top_k 0, top_p 1.0,
# min_p 0". A client that sends no sampler (DSH sends none) then samples this 3.05 bpw checkpoint at raw
# T=1.0 with no truncation and no penalty, and the reasoning spirals: 2026-09-16 a DSH request degenerated
# into multilingual word salad after ~10k tokens and the model emitted an end-of-thinking tag inside the
# debris, so the tag closed the reasoning channel mid-thought and the rest of the spiral arrived as the
# visible answer. The same request with a sampler runs coherent and calls its tool (see R338). The preset
# below supplies FALLBACKS only (force: false), so a client that sends its own sampler keeps it.

# The first version of this launcher copied 131,072 into both from a TEST config, halving the served window for

# The earlier "~6.08 GiB budget / 444k tokens" figure was derived from FREE VRAM and was wrong -- free VRAM is
# not allocatable VRAM. The split is pinned BY HAND below (`gpu_split: [30, 30]`, `gpu_split_auto: false`), and the
# weights plus the whole cache have to fit inside that split, so the ceiling is well below the arithmetic. (An
# earlier version of this sentence said exllamav3 "autosplits" -- it does not; the autosplit branch is taken only

# Validate the generated file inside the image that will run it, while the old container still serves.
# `config.load()` is the same code path boot uses (file -> merge -> model_validate), so a rejection here
# is the rejection that otherwise becomes a crash-loop under ``: the container
# then shows "Restarting" in `docker ps` for the whole health wait and looks alive, which is how r407f
# held :8022 down on 2026-09-16 while the session moved on. ~0.4 s, measured. Two failure modes it makes
# impossible: a wrong literal (`draft_mode: none`, r407 v1 / r397) and a legal literal with an illegal
# combination (the policy line under `disabled`, r407 v2).
# The capture goes to a mktemp file, not $LOG.preflight: a root-owned stale file in the logs dir once
# made a healthy boot read as a validation failure (r643, 2026-09-22). Diagnostic-only output does not
