# Qwen3.8-Flash-Next on 2× RTX 5090 (ExLlamaV3 + TabbyAPI)

Serving configuration, launcher, image recipe, kernel overlays, instruments and measurements for [Qwen3.8-Flash-Next][qwen-hf], served as [r0b0tlab's 2.50 bpw EXL3 pack][ckpt-250] by [TabbyAPI][tabby] on [ExLlamaV3][exl3] v1.5.0 across two RTX 5090 cards. The window is 262,144 tokens, the KV cache is 8-bit, and vision, reasoning, tool calls, structured output and the checkpoint's own MTP draft head are all on.

Every number here was measured on one machine on the date given, and each links the write-up that names its raw results directory. None is an estimate. The index of experiments is [`bench/RESULTS.md`][results], newest first.

## Numbers

Decode on `tabbyapi:stack-r3-rows32`, the served configuration (draft-KV window off since [R728][r728], memory clock offset +4500), measured 2026-09-25 07:59 to 08:16 UTC ([R719b][r719b], results `2026-09-25-r719-decode-curve`): `fn_bench --distinct`, so each stream has its own prompt; greedy, 1,024 forced tokens per request, short prompts, all streams starting together, two boots. Rates are tokens per second after each request's first token; the aggregate is the sum over the streams running together. Method: [How the numbers are measured](#how-the-numbers-are-measured).

![Decode rate after the first token against concurrency, sum over streams and per stream](docs/img/decode-scaling.svg)

- The aggregate rises at every step from 1 to 8 streams, from 5 to 6 streams as well (code 691 to 727 t/s, prose 694 to 735); the draft policy keeps two draft tokens from 5 to 8 streams ([Conditions](#conditions)).
- The rates depend on how often the MTP draft is accepted, which depends on the text being generated: on these ~110-token prompts a decode step yields 2.25 to 2.31 tokens at 5 to 8 streams ([R719b][r719b]).
- Time to the first token is 0.13 to 0.14 s at 1 stream and 0.70 to 0.75 s at 8 streams. The numbers behind the figure are in [How the numbers are measured](#how-the-numbers-are-measured).
- These are batches on an otherwise idle server. A three-agent session delivered 65.6 t/s per stream, because incoming prompts' prefill chunks stall the running streams ([R583][r583]; [Conditions](#conditions)).

![Cold prefill rate and decode rate at depth against prompt length](docs/img/prefill.svg)

Cold prefill keeps its rate up to the top of the window: 199,844 tokens in 18.8 s, 240,047 in 22.8 s (2026-09-20, [R580][r580]). Decode on an already-prefilled context keeps its rate at every depth measured ([R554][r554]).

| boot to serving | ~20 s, warm kernel caches | [R525][r525] |

Also passing: structured output (`json_schema`, `response_format`, `regex_pattern`, thinking on and off, [R453][r453]); `tool_choice` `required` 48/48, named 4/4, 8/8 concurrent ([R529][r529]); a long prompt prefilled twice gives identical output ([R535][r535]).

### Conditions

- **Agent traffic.** On the same server, one 3,000-token generation at ~10k context decodes at 236 t/s after its first token alone, 154 while fresh ~45k-token prompts arrive every 8 seconds, and 141 with two other long generations running (2026-09-20). Sampling at temperature 0.6 costs a further 0 to 24 % ([R584, R585][r585]). The three-agent figure is generated tokens over generation time in the server's own request log ([R583][r583]). A 45k-token prompt is 22 chunks of 2,048 tokens, and each chunk is a forward pass in which the running streams do not decode; context depth and generation length do not account for the loss ([R583][r583]).
- **Draft depth.** The served policy drafts three tokens up to 4 streams and two at 5 to 8 streams; at 6 to 8 streams that is 18 to 24 verify rows, which the decode paths take since 2026-09-25 ([R717, R717c][r717]). Before then the cooperative MoE decode kernels took 16 verify rows, and the policy dropped to one draft token at 6 streams ([R560][r560], [R562][r562], [R576][r576]).
- **Code and prose.** Code decodes 7.1 % faster than prose per stream at 1 stream, and prose 1.0 % faster than code at 8 streams ([R719b][r719b]). On this benchmark's code prompt the draft is accepted about as often as on prose (1.57 against 1.55 drafts per verify, [R572][r572]).
- **Slots.** 8 slots raise throughput over 4 on synthetic concurrency but not on the agent replay, which spends two thirds of its wall time at 5–7 concurrent calls ([R558][r558], [R557][r557]).
- **KV precision.** 8-bit KV costs 0.2–0.3 accepted drafts per verify against full precision ([R572][r572]).
- **Page pool.** The pool is bounded by whichever card holds more of the 12 full-attention layers ([R579][r579]). The `gpu_split` budget does not move the boundary, and the decode graphs take 790 MiB on the bounding card ([R581][r581]).

## Served configuration

- Since 2026-09-25 05:52 CEST ([R728][r728]): image `tabbyapi:stack-r3-rows32` (since 01:05 CEST, [R717c][r717]), launcher [`scripts/launch-flashnext.sh`][launcher]. Its patches are listed under [What the stack is](#what-the-stack-is) and in [`docker/`][docker-readme]; each promotion is a row in [`docs/HISTORY.md`](docs/HISTORY.md), and every setting is explained in [`docs/CONFIG.md`](docs/CONFIG.md).
- 8 slots, 983,040-token page pool, 8-bit KV.
- MTP draft depth 3 up to 4 jobs and 2 at 5 to 8 jobs (`[[4, 3], [8, 2]]`); the draft cache is page-indexed over the whole pool on the second GPU, without the 16,384-token window served from [R579][r579] to [R728][r728].
- Layer split `[30, 30]`, with the MTP draft component on the second GPU ([R694][r694]).

## What the stack is

- **Checkpoint**: [r0b0tlab/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-EXL3-2.50bpw][ckpt-250], routed experts at K = 2, 3 and 4 bits. It boots a 2.18× larger pool than [turboderp's 3.05 bpw pack][ckpt-turbo] and decodes 3–8 % faster except code at c1 ([R495b][r495b]); both score the same on GSM8K ([R509][r509]).
- **Engine**: [ExLlamaV3][exl3] v1.5.0 under [TabbyAPI][tabby] `53da7919`, plus the chain in [`docker/`][docker-readme]. Every patch is opt-in by environment flag and was admitted with byte-identical greedy output, or with GSM8K, needles and tool-eval where it changes numerics:
  - [exllamav3#337][pr337]: keeps the CUDA device on the module's device during a layer-split forward ([R362][r362]).
  - multi-job QSA sparse attention and concurrency-indexed draft depth ([R341][r341], [R340][r340]).
  - the fused MoE decode path at 16 rows ([R414][r414]) and a wide stage-B tile ([R421][r421]).
  - bit-exact V2 of the hyper-connection mixer and of the fused MoE decode kernel ([R428][r428], [R460][r460]).
  - a two-card prefill pipeline without blocking host syncs ([R442][r442]).
  - the shared expert on a side CUDA stream, +3 to +7 % decode ([R490][r490]).
  - pinned draft staging, one readback per verify step and a 65,536-token draft head, +2 to +3 % decode ([R499][r499]).
  - grouped MoE prefill for every K, +16 to +21 % cold prefill ([R513][r513]).
  - one-warp launches of two small decode kernels at 1 stream and a re-gridded mixer state kernel, +1.0 to +1.1 % decode at 1 stream ([R538][r538]).
  - a 20-row ring for the QSA indexer's raw keys, bit-exact, +20 % page pool ([R546][r546]).
  - GDN recurrent state stored in bf16 with fp32 math, +5 % page pool, GSM8K 0.974 and tool-eval 86.8 ([R548][r548]).
  - a windowed MTP draft cache, a sink page plus the last 16,384 tokens per slot, +3.4 % page pool ([R579][r579]). In the image and off since 2026-09-25: under the window a prompt revived from the prompt cache in a later request group drafts 0.655 accepted per proposed token against 0.868 without it, and an agent-shaped replay decodes 2.0 % faster per stream without it ([R728][r728]).
  - a batched draft verifier, one verify call for all jobs, +1 to +4 % decode ([R646][r646]).
  - the MTP input-norm fusion, a fused int8 state-in-up mixer kernel and grouped MTP accept-prefill batching, +4.4 % decode at 8 streams, byte-identical output ([R653][r653]).
  - a slot returned to the recurrent-state pool when state construction fails; before, each failure lost one of the 8 slots until restart ([R676][r676]).
  - the MTP draft component loaded on the second GPU (`draft_gpu_split: [0, 32]`), +2.0 to +2.9 % prose decode at 1 to 8 streams and +2.2 % at 26k context, mean of three alternating pairs, greedy output identical ([R694][r694]).
  - the hyper-connection mixer's int8 kernels with each weight converted once per iteration, the loads batched and the reduction as a reduce-scatter ([R698, R699][r698]), and the routed-expert MoE decode kernels with a cp.async weight ring, an activation prefetch and one counter arrival per item ([R700b][r700b]); both bitwise-identical, admitted on the stack-track rule in [`docs/PROMOTION.md`][promotion] and promoted together: 1.051 to 1.093 times the per-stream prose decode rate at 1 to 8 streams and 1.064 times at 26k context, mean of three alternating pairs, greedy output identical ([R701][r701]).
  - a second batch of bitwise-identical decode changes: the mixer kernels' round 2 with per-row-count tiles ([R702][r702]); the Gated-DeltaNet recurrence held in registers, the QSA indexer as a parallel CUDA-graph branch and compile options for the QSA split and combine kernels ([R712][r712]); V2 twins of the dense K=4 decode GEMM, mgemm and gemv kernels ([R714][r714]); the round-2 MoE decode kernels with the shared expert forked before the router ([R713][r713]). Promoted together on 2026-09-24 as `stack-r3`: 1.149, 1.088 and 1.087 times the per-stream prose decode rate of `stack-r2` at 1, 4 and 8 streams at about 4k tokens of context, and 1.104 times at 26k tokens and 4 streams (canonical gate, 1,024 forced tokens, greedy, mean over three alternating pairs of the per-request median, results `2026-09-24-r716b-stack-r3`); logits identical to `stack-r2` at every served decode shape ([R716b, R716c][r716b]).
  - decode paths for 17 to 32 rows (the routed-expert MoE decode in one launch, the shared expert and the dense GEMMs at 32 rows), so that 6 to 8 jobs verify at draft depth 2 instead of 1; host code only, each MoE output at 17 to 32 rows equal to two served 16-row calls. Promoted on 2026-09-25 as `stack-r3-rows32` with the policy `[[4, 3], [8, 2]]` and a page pool 1.6 % smaller: about +3 % per-stream decode (0 to +6 % across cells) at 6 and 8 streams at the 16k and 32k context settings (prompts of 12,000 to 44,000 tokens), and up to +16 to +21 % at 6 streams with 4k context, where the output is highly predictable; 1 to 5 streams unchanged (1,024 forced tokens, greedy, code and prose, mean over three alternating pairs of the per-boot median, results `2026-09-24-r717c-rows32-context`, [R717, R717b, R717c][r717]).
- **Cards**: layer split, 30 GB of weights and cache per card. `qwen4_exp` raises `NotImplementedError` for tensor parallelism in this engine, so the cards take turns over their own layers, and one stream keeps each card 44–47 % busy (2026-09-16, 3.05 bpw pack, [GPU duty cycle][duty]). Expert parallelism was built and measured at −9.5 % at 1 stream (results `2026-09-16-r408-ep-served`). Tensor parallelism was bounded before it was built: from measured half-work kernel times and all-reduce costs, a TP step would be at most 1.07–1.08× faster at 1 and 4 streams (2026-09-19, [R527][r527]).
- **Speculative decoding**: the checkpoint's MTP head, depth 3 up to 4 concurrent jobs and depth 2 at 5 to 8 (`[[4, 3], [8, 2]]`, since [R717c][r717]; from [R576][r576] to then depth 1 at 6 to 8, `[[4, 3], [5, 2], [8, 1]]`). Confidence-gated dynamic depth crashed at 4 streams ([R497][r497]).
- **Sampler fallbacks**: temperature 0.6, top_k 20, top_p 0.95 with `force: false`, so a client that sends its own sampler keeps it. Without a preset TabbyAPI serves sampler-less requests at temperature 1.0 untruncated ([`docs/GOTCHAS.md`][gotchas]).
- **Guard rails**: the launcher refuses to start without the checkpoint or the image, stops any other engine holding the cards, waits for them to drain and mounts the kernel caches. Every promotion re-runs the gates in [`docs/PROMOTION.md`][promotion] on the exact launcher.

## Hardware

Read from the box on 2026-09-19. Every number in this README was measured on this hardware and driver; the memory clock offset is stated per period below.

- Host: ASRock X870 Taichi Creator, AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D, 64 GB DDR5-6000 (2 × 32 GB), Ubuntu 24.04.4 LTS, kernel 7.0.0-30-generic.
- GPUs: two RTX 5090 32 GB (`sm_120`) on PCIe Gen5 x8/x8. Power limits are the cards' defaults, 600 W (ASUS, `cuda:0`) and 575 W (HP OEM, `cuda:1`). Memory clock offset +4500 MHz on both cards, core clock stock. A boot-time service applies them once per host boot, and since 2026-09-25 the launcher sets the memory offset before every engine boot and logs the readback. The offset had reset to 0 between 2026-09-03 and 2026-09-19 without a reboot, so the numbers measured from 2026-09-19 to 2026-09-25 02:22 UTC ran at the stock memory clock; +4500 is +14.3 % DRAM bandwidth and +1.7 to +1.8 % decode per stream at 1 stream ([R726][r726]).
- Driver: NVIDIA 610.57.04 open kernel modules, CUDA 13.3 user-mode driver.
- Storage: one KIOXIA KBG80ZNV2T04 2 TB NVMe (ext4) holds the checkpoint, including the 18.5 GiB n-gram embedding table that decode reads rows from, and the NVMe prefix tier. A sequential 16 MiB `O_DIRECT` read of a tier segment ran at 6.7 GB/s (2026-09-19).

## In progress (2026-09-20)

- Upstream's tiled hyper-connection prefill mix ([`825db5b`][exl3-825db5b]) ported onto this stack behind one flag: worth +14.0 % at 60k and +11.4 % at 120k where it was measured upstream ([R568][r568]), at 302 MiB per card there and a claimed 2.1 MiB here.
- One fused kernel per layer for the GDN linear-attention decode block, claimed bit-exact; GDN is 0.80 ms of a 13.9 ms 1-stream step ([R519][r519]).

## Measured and not served

Each entry names the change and the number that kept it out of the served configuration. c1, c4 and c6 mean 1, 4 and 6 concurrent streams.

- Mixed draft depth per job inside one verify batch, so 5 to 7 streams fill the 16 verify rows: 0.79× at 5 streams and 0.84× at 7, code, 256 forced tokens, greedy. The verify window grows to the deepest job in the batch, which adds a sequential draft level to every step ([R678b][r678b]).
- 17 to 32 verify rows on the cooperative MoE kernels, as two calls of at most 16 rows: bit-identical, −14.5 % at 8 streams against drafting one token ([R566][r566]). One launch of up to 32 rows is served since 2026-09-25 ([R717][r717]).
- Draft depth 2 above 4 jobs on the 16-row decode paths: −32 to −39 % at 6 and 8 streams, because 18 and 24 verify rows fell off the cooperative MoE decode kernels (2026-09-19, [R560][r560], [R562][r562]). With the rows32 paths depth 2 at 6 to 8 jobs is served since 2026-09-25 ([R717][r717]).
- Draft depth 4 at 1 stream, with or without a controller: costs 32,768 page-pool tokens and returns at most about +2 % ([R567][r567]).
- A deeper MTP draft for a single decoding job (depth 4 or 5 instead of 3), all arms at a 753,664-token pool: +4.8 / +5.2 % code and −5.4 / −8.2 % prose at 1 stream against depth 3, 16,384 / 49,152 fewer pool tokens than the served 819,200 of that date, and a different greedy output (2026-09-19, [R537][r537]).
- Adaptive MTP draft depth, round 2: −2.4 to −3.5 % prose at 1 stream, no gain on code ([R556][r556]).
- Two draft chains verified together: +5 to +6.5 % accepted tokens for twice the verify rows, modelled at −10 to −13 % ([R564][r564]).
- A 4,096-token prefill chunk: does not boot beside the page pool ([R574][r574]).
- Prefill chunk 1,024 or 512 instead of 2,048: running streams get 1.5× the decode frames while another request prefills, but cold prefill runs at about half the rate and the new request waits 1.4–1.7× longer for its first token ([R553][r553]). Chunk 1,024 for pool size: [R483][r483], [R485][r485].
- The served stack on upstream `dev`: −49,152 pool tokens and 1–3 % decode ([R563][r563]).
- The MTP draft's embedding copy on cuda:0: +16,384 pool tokens for −1.8 % code and −2.0 % prose at 1 stream ([R555][r555]).
- The K=3 MoE decode kernel without register spills: bit-exact, slower per call in 28 of 30 kernel cells, −0.37 % code at c1 over 8 boots with a 95 % interval of −0.83 to +0.09 % (2026-09-19, [R536][r536]).
- Recurrent checkpoints stored at the end of each reply: correct, but they save about 9k prefill tokens over a 120-call agent replay, below its run-to-run spread ([R524][r524]).
- A fused shared-expert kernel: after the side-stream overlap the shared expert's residual is 1.9 µs per layer at 4 rows, at most 0.6 % of a 1-stream step and 1.2 % at 4 streams ([R521][r521]).
- `EXL3_INT8_GEMV=0`: −0.3 % at c1 with a 95 % interval of ±1.2 % over 8 boots ([R520b][r520b]).
- 6 decode slots: +17 % at c6 and 9 % slower on an 8-agent replay, measured before the bf16 GDN state halved the per-slot cost ([R518][r518]).
- Split [30, 31] at 393,216 ([R487][r487]).
- The n-gram table in host RAM: +1–2 % for 30.5 GiB ([R484][r484]).
- The host KV tier ([R358][r358], [R493][r493]); GDN state replay ([R496][r496]); a 4-bit MTP graft ([R498][r498]); CPU-offloaded experts ([R482][r482]); MoE coop mode 3 ([R462][r462]).
- Prompt lookup: +3–4 % on code at c1, flat at c4 ([R501][r501]).
- K8V4: +18 % pool for −11 % code at c1 ([R480][r480]).
- [exllamav3#303][pr303] MTP hot vocabulary ([R377][r377]); [exllamav3#246][pr246] and [#290][pr290] ([R365][r365]); a 32-row MoE decode envelope written for this stack ([R366][r366]).
- The same checkpoint on vLLM through [vllm-exl3][vllm-exl3]: 0.62× the c1 and 1.06–1.12× the c4 of this stack's 3.05 bpw configuration of 2026-09-18. Work on that route stopped the same day ([vLLM route][vllm-route]).

## How the numbers are measured

**Decode** ([R719b][r719b], 2026-09-25 07:59 to 08:16 UTC, results `2026-09-25-r719-decode-curve`, driver [`scripts/r719-decode-curve.sh`](scripts/r719-decode-curve.sh)): `fn_bench` ([`bench/probe.py`][probe]) against the served launcher of `tabbyapi:stack-r3-rows32` (41 environment keys, draft-KV window off, memory clock offset +4500) on two boots, greedy, 1,024 forced tokens (`min_tokens`), a warm-up round plus three recorded rounds per shape, NVMe tier off. `--distinct` appends a per-stream suffix to each request's prompt, so no two streams of a round share a prompt; prompts are 118 tokens (code) and 106 tokens (prose), and no request revives a cached prefix. The two boots agree within 1.5 % on the per-stream rate and on the decode aggregate in every cell.

- **Decode rate per stream**: the median over requests of (tokens − 1) / (time of the last token − time of the first token).
- **Decode aggregate**: the sum of the decode rates of the requests running together. At 2 to 8 streams every stream decodes during 92.8 to 100.0 % of the round's mean decode window, so the sum overstates the rate the streams sustain together by at most about 8 %.
- **End-to-end burst aggregate**: all streams' tokens over the round's wall time, including time to the first token and the tail after the first stream finishes.

| streams | decode per stream, t/s, code / prose | decode aggregate, t/s, code / prose | time to first token, s, code / prose | end-to-end burst aggregate, t/s, code / prose |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 1 | 298.4 / 278.6 | 298 / 279 | 0.14 / 0.13 | 287 / 269 |
| 2 | 207.6 / 204.7 | 415 / 412 | 0.24 / 0.23 | 396 / 384 |
| 3 | 182.2 / 181.0 | 541 / 542 | 0.35 / 0.33 | 495 / 509 |
| 4 | 157.8 / 159.9 | 632 / 643 | 0.46 / 0.43 | 583 / 591 |
| 5 | 137.7 / 138.8 | 691 / 694 | 0.56 / 0.54 | 635 / 641 |
| 6 | 121.2 / 122.6 | 727 / 735 | 0.62 / 0.62 | 671 / 679 |
| 7 | 112.7 / 113.3 | 784 / 792 | 0.69 / 0.66 | 724 / 732 |

**Prefill** ([R580][r580], 2026-09-20): three salted cold prompts per depth, counted by the server, NVMe tier off; the decode-at-depth points are [R554][r554]. The kernels changed since then are decode-only; time to the first token on short prompts is 0.13 to 0.14 s at 1 stream on `stack-r3-rows32` ([R719b][r719b]). R580's prefill ran at the stock memory clock ([R726][r726]).

Figures are drawn from the raw records in `bench/results/` by [`bench/plot.py`](bench/plot.py) (`uv run bench/plot.py`).

## Reproducing a boot

```sh
ssh flan 'bash -s' < scripts/launch-flashnext.sh                  # serve on :8022
PORT=8023 bash scripts/launch-flashnext.sh                        # a second instance
IMG=tabbyapi:decode-kernels-r4 EXTRA_ENV= bash scripts/launch-flashnext.sh   # an older image, patches off
STOP=1 bash scripts/launch-flashnext.sh                           # stop
```

Rebuilding the image chain, running the measurements and handing the box back are in [`docs/RUNBOOK.md`][runbook].

## Repository map

| path | what it is |
| --- | --- |
| [`scripts/launch-flashnext.sh`][launcher] | the served launcher: writes the config and the sampler preset, starts the container, warms the kernels |
| [`scripts/launchers/`][launchers] | the launcher of each promotion and experiment, for rollback and reproduction |
| [`scripts/r*.sh`][scripts] | one driver per experiment, each under the box's GPU lock |
| [`docker/`][docker-readme] | the served image layer by layer: Dockerfiles, patches, overlays with SHA-pinned installers and kernel tests |
| [`bench/RESULTS.md`][results] | index of every experiment, newest first; one file per experiment in [`bench/results/`][bench-results] with its raw records |
| [`bench/probe.py`][probe] | decode, concurrency and depth instrument (`fn_bench`): forced length via `min_tokens`, one JSONL line per request |
| [`bench/multiprompt.py`][multiprompt], [`bench/agentic-edit.py`][agentic-edit] | sampled multi-prompt decode, and agent-shaped file edits |
| [`bench/needle.py`][needle], [`bench/capabilities.py`][capabilities] | long-context retrieval at five planted positions; JSON schema, tool parsing, vision and reasoning checks |
| [`bench/nostop_proxy.py`][nostop] | drops the request's `stop` field so lm-eval's stop strings cannot cut reasoning |
| [`bench/agent_replay.py`][agent-replay], [`bench/revisit.py`][revisit] | recorded agent conversations replayed at concurrency; revisits of evicted long sessions |
| [`docs/CONFIG.md`][config] | every setting and flag, and why it has that value |
| [`docs/HISTORY.md`][history] | how the served configuration changed, with the result behind each step |
| [`docs/PROMOTION.md`][promotion] | the gates a candidate passes before it is served |
| [`docs/GOTCHAS.md`][gotchas] | the traps, as "what it looks like" against "what it is" |
| [`docs/RUNBOOK.md`][runbook] | serve, measure, rebuild and hand the box back |
| [`THIRD_PARTY.md`][third-party] | where every input came from and under which licence |
| [`CLAUDE.md`][claude-md] | the working agreement: prose rules, box rules, measurement rules |

## Attribution and licence

The original work here (documentation, instruments, launcher, overlay installers, measurements) is [MIT][license]. The model is the Qwen team's under the Qwen Community License; the checkpoints are [r0b0tlab's][ckpt-250] and [turboderp's][ckpt-turbo]; the engine is [ExLlamaV3][exl3] (MIT) and the server [TabbyAPI][tabby] (AGPL-3.0), and every kernel patch in [`docker/`][docker-readme] is a derivative of one of them. The patches were written with coding agents from static source dumps and admitted or rejected by measurement on the box. Ideas were taken from [vcruz305's DGX Spark recipe][vcruz-recipe], [DominikBucko][bucko], [HaberstrohSystems][haberstroh] and [halogen][halogen]; the full table is in [`THIRD_PARTY.md`][third-party].
